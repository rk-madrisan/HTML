            Explore a Wide Selection of Used Cars for Sale in India
            It is a dream that most people have to own a car regardless of the life standards that they might have. It has
            now become a utility apart from being a point of prestige. India has many choices for those seeking to buy a car
            and all sorts of varieties in terms of model and price. There is a common preference for the new car because it
            is usually associated with high prices. It becomes a decision between buying a basic model that costs less or
            paying more money and getting all the extras of the top model car.

            But used cars are the answer to this question. It gives the buyers an opportunity to own an advanced feature car
            at a throw away price as compared to owning a new car. According to the market preference of India, many
            consumers prefer to buy used cars instead of new cars because it is more affordable.

            May it be for a used car or a new one, Droom makes it easier for car buyers to find the right car for them. Like
            most online marketplaces of used vehicles, Droom has different vehicle brands from reputable automakers such as
            Honda, Hyundai, Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Tata and many others, and it is easier to narrow the results based on
            make, model, year, transmission type, body type, price range, kilometer read-out, color, variant or degree of
            usage.

            Most Reliable Used Cars for Sale in India
            Dependability is always a crucial element of any vehicle purchase even though it is more crucial when purchasing
            a second-hand vehicle. On the one hand, buying a new car means that the car is protected by the warranty, and
            the buyer knows for sure that nothing is wrong with it; on the other hand, used cars are different. This is
            because they would love to know in terms of history, the condition the car is in, and how it performs.

            In an effort to assist its clients in making a suitable decision while buying used cars, Droom has provided
            various services so that the buyer acquires a reliable as well as a proper functioning used car.

            Droom History is a service through which you can know the past of a used car – about its previous owners, if it
            has met an accident, whether serviced regularly or not etc.

            Another useful service is Droom ECO which helps to evaluate the physical condition of the old car for their
            proper working condition and for long usage.

            On such services, Droom enables buyers to make secure investments in used cars, among other automobile products.

            Used Car Prices in India
            Pricing continues to be the most relevant consideration at the time of purchase, including the car’s age. Out of
            the analysis of the price range of a car it would be easy to advise the market segment they belong to and the
            target demographic that the manufactures have in mind. It is vital to understand the range from which the used
            car is priced because it allows for filter criteria to be set and find a used car you are willing to pay for.

            In addition to selling new cars, Droom has a specific feature for those who are interested in purchasing a
            second-hand car, called OBV – Orange Book Value which gives fair market value of the used car. This feature
            enables you to judge whether or not the particular price for the used car is affordable given the days it has
            spent already, and its condition among others. To give a brief idea, here are some of the used car models and
            their fair market value:

            Honda Elevate ZX CVT - Rs. 15.11 Lakhs
            Maruti Suzuki Alto K10 VXi - Rs. 1.85 Lakhs
